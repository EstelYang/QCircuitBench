Given the initial state $\ket{{0}}^{{\otimes n}}$, we want to apply a quantum circuit $C$ to transform it into a target state $\ket{{\psi}}$, i.e. $C \ket{{0}}^{{\otimes n}} = \ket{{\psi}}$. It is known that the transformation operator can be implemented with the approximately universal gate set: {{H, S, T, CNOT}} without ancilla qubits. The input and output qubits are indexed from $0$ to $n−1$. Please design a circuit based on the above description, with $n=$ {qubit_number}, and the target state $\ket{{\psi}} = $ {target_state}. Please provide the corresponding quantum circuit implementation with Cirq using quantum gates from the given set.
Please define exactly the function below, without adding any arguments, docstrings, or renaming:
"def algorithm():"
the function must return a cirq.Circuit object.
Please strictly output in this format:
