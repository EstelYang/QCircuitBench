Given a function $f:\{0,1\}^n \rightarrow\{0,1\}$, the function returns $1$ for a unique marked item $w$, i.e. $f(x) = 1$ if $x = w$, $f(x) = 0$ if $x \neq w$. The oracle $U_f$ operates as $U_f\ket{x} = (-1)^{f(x)}\ket{x}$. The total number of the qubits for the oracle is $n$. The input qubits $\ket{x}$ are indexed from $0$ to $n-1$, and the output qubits are indexed from $0$ to $n-1$. Please design an oracle based on the above description, with $n = $\{qubit number\}, marked item $w = $\{marked item\}. Please provide the corresponding quantum circuit implementation with Cirq.
Please define exactly the function below, without adding any arguments, docstrings, or renaming:
"def oracle_circuit():"
the function must return a cirq.Circuit object.
Please strictly output in this format:
cirq```
