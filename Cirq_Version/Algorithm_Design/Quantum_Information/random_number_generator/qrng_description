The properties of quantum mechanics provide the opportunity to generate truly random numbers. Please design a quantum algorithm to generate $n$-bit random numbers. When you measure the circuit, please follow the format "circuit.append(cirq.measure(qubits[i], key=f"c{i}"))" for each qubit. Please provide the following components for the algorithm design with $n = $\{qubit number\}: 1. the corresponding quantum circuit implementation with Cirq. 2. the post-processing code run_and_analyze(circuit) (circuit should be a cirq.Circuit object) in python which simulates the circuit and returns the generated random number according to the simulation results.
For part 1, please define exactly one function below, without adding any arguments, docstrings, or renaming:
"def algorithm():"
the function must return a cirq.Circuit object.
For part 2, please define exactly one function below, without adding any arguments, docstrings, or renaming:
"def run_and_analyze(circuit):"
this function must return a str, which is the generated random number.
Please strictly output in this format:
cirq```
