Consider an unstructured search problem. Given a black box function $f:\{0,1\}^n \rightarrow\{0,1\}$, it is known that there exists a unique marked item $w$ such that $f(w) = 1$, i.e. $f(x) = 1$ if $x = w$, $f(x) = 0$ if $x \neq w$. Please design a quantum algorithm to find $w$. The function is provided as a black-box oracle gate named "Oracle" implemented as Cirq Gate which operates as $O_f\ket{x} = (-1)^{f(x)}\ket{x}$. It should be applied in the circuit using "circuit.append(Oracle.on(*qubits))". The input qubits $\ket{x}$ are indexed from $0$ to $n-1$, and the output qubits are indexed from $0$ to $n-1$. When you measure the circuit, please follow the format "circuit.append(cirq.measure(qubits[i], key=f"c{i}"))" for each qubit. Please provide the following components for the algorithm design with $n = $\{qubit number\}: 1. the corresponding quantum circuit implementation with Cirq. 2. the post-processing code run_and_analyze(circuit)  (circuit should be a cirq.Circuit object) in python which simulates the circuit and returns the marked item $w$ according to the simulation results.
For part 1, please define exactly one function below, without adding any arguments, docstrings, or renaming:
"def algorithm(Oracle):"
the function must return a cirq.Circuit object.
For part 2, please define exactly one function below, without adding any arguments, docstrings, or renaming:
"def run_and_analyze(circuit):"
this function must return a str, which is the marked item $w$.
Please strictly output in this format:
cirq```
