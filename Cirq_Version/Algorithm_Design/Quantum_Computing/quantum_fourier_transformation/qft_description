Please design a quantum algorithm to implement the following transformation for the integer $x \in \{0,1\}^n$, $\ket{x} \longmapsto \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{y \in \mathbb{Z}_{2^n}} e^{\frac{2 \pi i x y}{2^n}}|y\rangle:=|\tilde{x}\rangle$. This transformation converts a state from the computational basis to the Fourier basis. The state $\ket{x}$ can be prepared from $\ket{0^n}$ with a black box gate named "Oracle" implemented as Cirq Gate. It should be applied in the circuit using "circuit.append(Oracle.on(*qubits))". When you measure the circuit, please follow the format "circuit.append(cirq.measure(qubits[i], key=f"c{i}"))" for each qubit. Please provide the following components for the algorithm design with $n = $\{qubit number\}: 1. the corresponding quantum circuit implementation with Cirq. 2. the post-processing code run_and_analyze(circuit)  (circuit should be a cirq.Circuit object) in python which returns the qubit indices of the transformed state $\ket{\tilde{x}}$ as a list, where circuit is the implemented circuit.
For part 1, please define exactly one function below, without adding any arguments, docstrings, or renaming:
"def algorithm(Oracle):"
the function must return a cirq.Circuit object.
For part 2, please define exactly one function below, without adding any arguments, docstrings, or renaming:
"def run_and_analyze(circuit):"
this function must return a list, which is the qubit indices of the transformed state $\ket{\tilde{x}}$.
Please strictly output in this format:
