Given a black box function $f: \{0,1\}^n \longmapsto \{0,1\}$. The function is known to be either constant (outputs $0$ for all inputs or $1$ for all inputs) or balanced (outputs $0$ for half of the inputs and  $1$ for the other half). Please design a quantum algorithm to determine whether the given function $f(x)$ is constant or balanced. The function is provided as a black-box oracle gate named "Oracle" implemented as Cirq Gate which operates as $O_f \ket{x}\ket{y} = \ket{x}\ket{y\oplus f(x)}$. It should be applied in the circuit using "circuit.append(Oracle.on(*qubits))". The input qubits $\ket{x}$ are indexed from $0$ to $n-1$. The output qubit $\ket{y}$ is indexed as qubit $n$. The output qubit $\ket{y}$ is indexed as qubit $n$. When you measure the circuit, please follow the format "circuit.append(cirq.measure(qubits[i], key=f"c{i}"))" for each qubit. Please provide the following components for the algorithm design with $n = $\{qubit number\}: 1. the corresponding quantum circuit implementation with Cirq. 2. the post-processing code run_and_analyze(circuit) (circuit should be a cirq.Circuit object) in python which simulates the circuit and returns either "constant" or "balanced" according to the simulation results.
For part 1, please define exactly one function below, without adding any arguments, docstrings, or renaming:
"def algorithm(Oracle):"
the function must return a cirq.Circuit object.
For part 2, please define exactly one function below, without adding any arguments, docstrings, or renaming:
"def run_and_analyze(circuit):"
this function must return a str, which is the function type string: "constant" or "balanced".
Please strictly output in this format:
