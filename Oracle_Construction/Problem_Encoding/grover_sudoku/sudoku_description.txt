Given a $2 \times 2$ Sudoku board, we would like to assign $0$ or $1$ to each cell following two rules: no row may contain the same value twice, and no column may contain the same value twice. Please design an oracle for Grover's algorithm to verify the correctness of the solution. The cells on the board are labeled from $0$ to $3$, with the corresponding input qubits indexed from $0$ to $3$ representing the assigned values. The output qubit is indexed as $4$. You may use any number of ancilla qubits starting from index $5$. Please provide the corresponding quantum circuit implementation with OpenQASM 3.0 using quantum gates provided in the standard gate library. Additionally, you may use a Multi-Controlled X gate (denoted as "mcx"), which uses qubits $0$ to $3$ as control qubits and qubit $4$ as the target. The "mcx" gate is provided in the "customgates.inc" file. Please save the oracle as a gate named "Oracle".
