Given a graph with $n = $\{qubit number\} nodes, we would like to check whether any subgraph formed by three nodes contains a triangle. The nodes are labeled from $0$ to $n-1$, and the edges are \{edge list\}. Please design an oracle for Grover's algorithm to verify the presence of a triangle. The input qubits corresponding to the nodes are indexed from $0$ to $n-1$, where the state represents whether the node is in the subgraph. To simplify the construction, it is guaranteed that the input would only consider subgraphs with $3$ nodes, i.e. states with three $1$'s. The output qubit is indexed as $n$. You may use any number of ancilla qubits starting from index $n+1$. Please provide the corresponding quantum circuit implementation with OpenQASM 3.0 using quantum gates provided in the standard gate library. Additionally, you may use a Multi-Controlled X gate (denoted as "mcx"), which uses qubits $0$ to $2$ as control qubits and qubit $3$ as the target. The "mcx" gate is provided in the "customgates.inc" file. Please save the oracle as a gate named "Oracle".
