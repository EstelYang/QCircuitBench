Please design a quantum algorithm to factor the integer $N$ with given $a$. Please provide the following components for algorithm design to factor $N = $\{The number needed to factor\} with $a = $\{coprime base\}. The quantum circuit should have $n = $\{qubit number\}: 1. the corresponding quantum circuit implementation with \{QASM / Qiskit\}. 2.the post-processing code run_and_analyze(circuit, aer_sim, N, a) in python which simulates the circuit (QuantumCircuit) with aer_sim (AerSimulator) and returns the factors of $N$ according to the simulation results.
